This is an attempt at creating a BusyBox-like set of binaries
for ELKS.

I am awful at Makefiles, so I wrote a rudimentary Makefile and 
wrote a shell script to oversee the build process. Run ./build 
and wait for it. When it's finished, you will have three
BusyELKS binaries and a series of symbolic links for them.
They will be set up under the _install/ directory exactly as
they need to appear in a root filesystem.
